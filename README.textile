h1. glogg - A fast, advanced log explorer

glogg is a multi-platform GUI application that helps browse and search
through long and complex log files.  It is designed with programmers and
system administrators in mind and can be seen as a graphical, interactive
combination of grep and less.

h2. Main features
* Runs on Unix-like systems, Windows and Mac thanks to Qt
* Provides a second window showing the result of the current search
* Supports grep/egrep like regular expressions
* Colorizes the log and search results
* Displays a context view of where in the log the lines of interest are
* Is fast and reads the file directly from disk, without loading it into memory
* Supports vim/less like keyboard commands to move around the file
* Is open source, released under the GPL
